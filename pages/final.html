    <header><h2>User Interviews</h2></header>
<p>Conducting user interviews is a commonly utilized user research technique, to elicit qualitative data from potential users of a product. These interviews are important because they help people grasp what their users are looking for in the product. Types of questions can be about the potential user’s background, relevant experience and more.

        <header><h2>Competitor Analysis</h2></header>
<p>A competitor analysis involves identifying competitors and assessing what they are doing in order to learn their strong points and weak points. I reviewed portfolio websites made by other university students because they will likely be my competitors, who also want hiring managers to notice them.

        <header><h2>Feature Value Matrix</h2></header>
<p>A feature value matrix is a matrix which maps features to different values. This matrix aids in determining what features should be prioritized, through grading them by the business, user and technical values. The features I selected were based on the course’s needs and features which I found to be important to my website portfolio.

        <header><h2>Feature Prioritization</h2></header>
<p>Feature prioritization is a strategy I used to choose the most important features to include onto my portfolio website, and to focus on incorporating those to the best of my ability. To do this, I used my feature value matrix, which was completed from analyzing data from the user interviews, and competitor analysis.

        <header><h2>User Stories</h2></header>
<p>User stories capture what users want and why. This is important so that we design our product to allow the user to find what they want. User stories are often written in the perspective of an end user, in a form where the form the story takes on is “As a (type of user), I want to _____ so I can _____.”

        <header><h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2></header>
<p>A cognitive walkthrough is a method of evaluating usability, where, in the context of this class, an evaluator asks a potential user to complete a set of tasks and their thoughts on the interface. I had an opportunity to see what was potentially good or bad about my site.

        <header><h2>User Test</h2></header>
<p>For user tests, I created two click tests on UsabilityHub, each on a different page of my portfolio website. I chose to use click tests to ask my testers to complete a task because I felt that those would help me learn if my layout was well-designed or if it was confusing. Some challenges I had was learning how UsabilityHub worked, and then asking a question that had just enough detail, without confusing my testers. From these user tests, I learned that my navigation bar’s labels were slightly confusing, and it led some users to click in the wrong area.

        <header><h2>Summary of Findings</h2></header>
        <p>For the competitive analysis portion of my user research, I looked for portfolios made by other students who were either in the field of Informatics, or were interested in looking for jobs in Software Designer or UX Design. I had found several personal portfolio websites by searching on LinkedIn. My initial thoughts on the websites I found were that they looked the very similar. The three I focused on analyzing were examples which I took the most from. The first two I found each had three sections, and were pretty clear in saying that they were portfolios. I liked the simplicity, and my resulting website reflects that, but I do want to make my website a little more special in the near future. The third one I analyzed had me definitely inspired to do something more creative, for my later updates, as I build my web developing skills. From that, I learned that there are many different layouts which could work for a personal portfolio websites.</p>
        <p>Aside from learning how layouts could be very creative, I learned what content should be available on my website if I wanted potential recruiters to look into contacting me, from both the competitive analysis and the user interviews. More specifically, these potential users wanted to see what my interests were, my projects and some detail about what I contribute to the project. The data helped me move onto prioritizing which features I would work on including into my initial website portfolio.</p>
        <p>After creating my initial website, I was able to gather new information. From the UsabilityHub testing, I learned that my navigation bar’s labels were slightly confusing, and it led some users to click in the wrong area. From the cognitive walkthroughs, I got great feedback on my website’s visual aspects, as all three of my testers noted that my website was a bit plain and that there was not much content. I was able to see the issues through my user’s perspective, and my flaws were much more clear than before.</p>
